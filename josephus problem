    return (jos(n-1,k)+k)%n ;   #Difference between jos(n,k) when 1 person killed and jos(n-1,k) is gun will be in kth person's hand in 1st case and 0th person's hand in latter case. To equate both, k is added. i.e, root strength of recusrion approach is reducing bigger problem into smaller itself.
